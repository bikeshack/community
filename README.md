# GOVERNANCE
---
Note that this repository is loosely modeled on the kubernetes open governance repository at https://github.com/kubernetes/community.  The goal is to apply the similar governance within the Cray / HPE community.  Phase 1 will seed the governance and Phase 2 will expand participation.

Details for current governance can be found [here](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/community/blob/main/governance.md).
